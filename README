Boot GCC
========

Bootstrapping gcc from version 1.27 up. Very early stages atm. Only have a self
hosted version of gcc-1.27 atm (see gcc1/).

Not sure how far I will get, might aim to just use this to quickly bootstrap a
useful version of gcc (which could in fact be 1.27). In this repo I will also
bootstrap the required versions of GNU gas and ld (plus Bison as early versions
of gcc use bison grammar definitions).

At the moment I only have gcc-1.27 and bison-1.00 in the tree, but the general
plan will be to pull in a version of the GNU assembler (gas) too. The broader
idea is to allow this to be bootstrapped from:

So it will be possible to start from nothing and quickly arrive at a usable
version of GCC.
